# Multi-Agent System - Product Definition

## Product Overview
The Multi-Agent System is an AI-powered platform that uses multiple specialized agents to address complex tasks across different domains. By leveraging the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol for standardized communication and integrating with various tools through autonomous discovery and selection, the system provides comprehensive, validated results with modular, independently deployable components. The system currently implements an orchestrator for multi-domain analysis, with support for additional orchestrator types for other specialized domains.

## Problem Statement
Traditional tools often provide limited perspectives, lack validation, and struggle with complex multi-domain tasks. Users need a system that can:
- Integrate multiple perspectives (technical, economic, social)
- Validate information from multiple sources
- Provide comprehensive analysis while maintaining modularity
- Scale independently based on task requirements
- Leverage specialized tools autonomously for enhanced capabilities

## Solution
A multi-agent system where specialized agents handle different domains, coordinated by domain-specific orchestrators that ensure information validation and comprehensive output. Agents autonomously discover and select appropriate tools for their tasks. All communication follows the A2A protocol for interoperability and standardized messaging.

## Target Users
- Business analysts
- Academic researchers
- Business intelligence teams
- Policy makers
- Anyone requiring comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis
- Users requiring specialized task processing across multiple domains

## Key Features
1. **Multi-Domain Processing**: Simultaneous processing across technical, economic, and social/cultural domains
2. **Fact-Checking Integration**: Built-in validation of all information
3. **Modular Architecture**: Independent, deployable agents that can be scaled individually
4. **A2A Protocol Compliance**: Standardized communication for agent interoperability
5. **Comprehensive Output**: Unified outputs combining multiple perspectives
6. **Autonomous Tool Discovery and Selection**: Agents can discover and select appropriate tools for their tasks
7. **Enhanced Capabilities**: Integration with various specialized tools for improved outcomes
8. **Real Tool Implementations**: Tools with actual functionality (web search, document parsing, statistical analysis) rather than mock implementations
9. **Independent Tool Management**: Tools are organized in separate directories with individual files and documentation for independent updates
10. **Flexible Orchestrator Architecture**: Support for different types of orchestrator agents (basic, advanced, custom workflows)
11. **Configurable Workflows**: JSON-based workflow definitions that enable visual orchestrator building
12. **Visual Orchestrator Builder**: User-friendly interface for creating custom workflows (future feature)

## User Journey
1. User submits a complex task or question
2. System parses the request and identifies required domains

4. Specialized agents (tech, economic, social/cultural) discover and select appropriate tools autonomously
5. Specialized agents perform domain-specific processing using appropriate tools with real implementations
6. Fact-checking agent validates all information and uses validation tools autonomously
7. System generates comprehensive, validated output
8. User receives detailed analysis with multiple perspectives
