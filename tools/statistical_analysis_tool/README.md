# Statistical Analysis Tool

The Statistical Analysis Tool enables agents to perform statistical analysis on provided data sets.

## Overview
This tool provides statistical analysis capabilities to agents in the Multi-Agent Research System. It allows agents to analyze numerical data and generate descriptive statistics.

## Parameters
- `data` (array, required): Array of numerical values to analyze
- `analysis_type` (string, optional, default: "descriptive"): Type of analysis to perform (currently only supports descriptive statistics)

## Output
The tool returns a structured response with:
- `analysis_type`: The type of analysis performed
- `input_data`: The original input data
- `statistics`: Statistical measures including count, mean, min, max, and range

## Usage Example
```json
{
  "data": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "analysis_type": "descriptive"
}
```

## Note
This is currently a mock implementation. In a real system, this would use libraries like numpy and scipy for comprehensive statistical functions.
