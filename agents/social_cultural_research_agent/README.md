# Social/Cultural Research Agent

The Social/Cultural Research Agent is a component of the Multi-Agent Research & Analysis System that specializes in analyzing social and cultural impacts of research queries.

## Purpose

The Social/Cultural Research Agent is designed to:

- Analyze the social implications of research topics
- Evaluate cultural impacts and considerations
- Assess how research topics affect different communities
- Identify potential social justice and equity considerations
- Provide insights on cultural sensitivity and representation

## Capabilities

- Receives research tasks from the orchestrator agent
- Performs social and cultural analysis using the Gemini LLM
- Integrates with tools to enhance social/cultural research capabilities
- Returns structured results to the orchestrator for aggregation

## Technical Implementation

This agent implements the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol and follows the same patterns as other agents in the system:

- Implements `get_capabilities()` to describe its functionality
- Handles `REQUEST_RESEARCH_TASK` messages from the orchestrator
- Can request and process results from tools using the tool framework
- Sends `RESPONSE_RESEARCH_RESULTS` back to the orchestrator

## Message Types

The agent supports the following A2A message types:

- `request:research-task` - Receives research tasks from the orchestrator
- `response:research-results` - Sends research results back to the orchestrator
- `response:tool-result` - Receives results from tools when used

## Integration

The Social/Cultural Research Agent integrates with:

- The Research Orchestrator Agent (receives tasks, sends results)
- The Tool Framework (uses tools for enhanced research)
- The LLM Interface (performs social/cultural analysis)
- The A2A Protocol (standardized communication)
